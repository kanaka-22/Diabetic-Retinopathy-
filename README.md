# Diabetic-Retinopathy :
▪Diabetic Retinopathy is a complication of diabetes and a leading cause of blindness.
▪ It occurs when diabetes damages the tiny blood vessels inside the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at 
the back of the eye.

# Objective :
The proposed work is to detect diabetic retinopathy in which clinical imaging mode 
is used for analyzing the eye health of the patient. The classification is based on No 
DR, mild Non-Proliferative DR, moderate Non-Proliferative DR, severe Non-Proliferative DR and proliferative DR using real-world datasets of DR images. A 
comparative analysis is done with various deep learning models like Convolution 
Neural Network, MobileNetv2, ResNet50, Inceptionv2, and VGG-16. The 
proposed model can also be used to make predictions and find accuracy using less 
number of images.
